## The project

This is a project created while taking the "JavaScript Bootcamp - Build Real World Applications" course created by "Code And Create" on UDEMY.

Because the purpose of this course and project is to learn and practice Java Script the HTML and CSS files are provided by "Code and Create" as a starting code.   

## The Quiz App

Being a quiz app, it includes 2 types of users:
- an administrator who can add, delete and edit questions
- users who take the quiz. At the end of the quiz, the user will receive a score.

The app includes also a score panel that contains all the users who have taken the quiz and their scores.

One of the main features of the application is that the questions and scores are stored in the local storage of the Browser, so if the user reloads the page or closes the browser the data won't be lost.
